<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

Currenlty this is an MVP in order to achieve the deadlines.

For future iterations I would like to add:
- Metrics
- Robust logger
- Health checker
- Need for a token to use the API in order to controll the amount of requests done
- Create a containarized version of the code in order to be able to escalate in the could provider
- Better UI
- Improve and create new tests to reach 100% coverage
- Include github actions to run test on PR open
- Fix testing console package errors

See the [open issues](https://github.com/victorgreco/product-advertisement-manager-frontend/issues) for a list of proposed features (and known issues).
